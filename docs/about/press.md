## About

Omnivore is a free and open-source project and an open community. Our mission is to make everyone enjoy reading.

Omnivore is built by a small distributed team of developers based in San Francisco and Singapore.

## Feature List

Power user's like to save articles, PDFs, and newsletters to Omnivore to read later. In the Omnivore Library they are able to organize all their saved reading, using tags, full-text-search, and filters. In the Omnivore Reader they enjoy distraction free reading, where cruft like ads and other nonsense are removed from their articles. The reader allows them to highlight and add notes, which are stored in Omnivore's Notebooks. Finally, all their reading, highlighting, and notes can be synced into popular Personal Knowledge Management systems like Logseq and Obsidian.
