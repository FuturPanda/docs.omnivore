Many people have asked us how we plan to sustain Omnivore's growth. Currently, as an open-source project we rely on the generosity of our community members. If you are interested in financially contributing to Omnivore, you can donate on our [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/omnivore). We use Open Collective funding to offset server costs, and pay third parties to help with things like copy editing and translations.

If you are interested in being listed as a Sponsor in Discord please notify us after contributing.

If you are interested in other ways of contributing to Omnivore, you can read our [Contributing blog post](https://blog.omnivore.app/p/contributing-to-omnivore).

## Future Pricing Plans

We have a few product ideas we have experimented with that would be paid add-ons to the current service: collaborative tools, AI integration, translation tools, and premium text to speech voices. Of these features, the premium text to speech voices are the only one that are currently available in the app, as part of our "ultra realistic voices" beta.
